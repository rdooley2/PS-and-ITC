<h2>My Personal Experience:</h2>
At first, I didn't want to do either of these because I was already planning on working on my SOC Level 1 Certification that the website offers. However, TryHackMe strongly suggested that I do these first and now I see why. I was hesitant at first but I'm glad I ended up completing both of these certifications because they helped a lot later on. They both give a very good introduction to the field itself and crucial fundamentals. I enjoyed getting to learn a lot about Linux as I had very little experience with this OS before. I also thoroughly enjoyed reviewing the Network Fundamentals as I know they are very important to this line of work.
